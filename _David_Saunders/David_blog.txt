The first BEWD class was mostly devoted to learning and understanding command line and terminal. Like any language, there is vocabulary and syntax that needs to be learned. 

Thankfully, many of the commands are pretty obvious (e.g., "mkdir" means "make directory"), which makes navigating terminal a bit easier. That said, some terms a bit of a stretch (e.g., "touch" creates a new blank file - why "touch"? and not "new" or "create"?). These are the ones that will require straight-up memorization. 

Given that I had completed the pre-work for class #1, much of the command line content was review. But when we transitioned into github, I quickly became a bit confused. I have had some experience using github via the browser, but had never interacted with it via git and terminal. The learning curve is a more than a little steeper..! My first attempt to push my blog.txt file was unsuccessful, and I needed some help removing the directory that I had accidentally connected with. Once I had that figured out, I was able to push my file to the appropriate repo and submit a pull request, although I haven't received confirmation yet that it's been received - I can only hope that it has..! :) 

In short, while I am feeling pretty good using terminal and command line to navigate my machine, I need to work on getting more facile with my understanding of git and github for my work.
