In todays class I have painfully mastered navigating in and out of folders using the command panel. While learning the following commands:

pwd: print working directoryhostname: my computer's network namemkdir: make directorycd:change directoryls: list directoryrmdir: remove directorypushd: push directorypopd: pop directory
../ go back a folder
